## Design documentation

### Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience

My sites audience would likely be employers, students or coding colleagues who want to
see a quick snapshot of my work background and projects. This makes it easier for them to
connect to me on multiple different avenues but also, gain insight into my personality.

My initial user stories and my design process and issue handling can be found at [Trelloboard](https://trello.com/b/WeldRh8d/site-audience)


### Demonstrate the design decisions you made

My design and usability of the site is simple and clear.

The nav bar I made sticky to add to user experience during scrolling.

The carousel was used to create an slideshow effect like an animated gif and contribute to my personal brand of being fun and outgoing.

The welcome I've made horizontal to add to the layout structure of the website and provide a unique contrast to the rest of the website.

The logo is large as it's on theme and I wanted it to look like a large neon sign.

I've made the background black to allow the text and other card tiles to stand out. I've added a hover function over the buttons to allow them to stand out and add an incentive to click through.

My content is succinct to provide an overall snapshot for the users of the website.

The headers glow and will stop glowing if you hover to provide a point of interest on the website and add a little quirk. My inspiration for this can be found via this [codepen](https://codepen.io/FelixRilling/full/qzfoc/).

The footer has the same buttons with an animated hover to encourage click through however the button text is more personable like my brand.

I've shrunk the nav on mobile devices and the site-map is available on each page of the site. It's straight forward and to the point and directs the user through each possible page option. The highlight hover feature on the buttons also encourages click through even on mobile.


### Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics

1. Visibility of system status - this is evident through the nav bar, where the links hover and highlight to provide the user with a guide on where to navigate to next. The fact that the nav bar is also sticky also promotes the visibility of the sections of the website as they scroll. The headers are large and they flash neon to remind the users that they've moved onto another section of the site.

2. Match between system and the real world - the language of the website is very casual, light-hearted and informal. I've used quotes and informal button text to come across more relatable. The icons are industry relevant so the audience will be able to distinguish the programs and forms of contact that I use.

3. User control and freedom - The animations on my website are based purely when the user hovers over the content. This allows them the user freedom as the navigate the website. The home bar is in the center of the site, and permanently navigates with the user allowing them without them having to do any thing extra than clicking a button.

4. Consistency and standards - The site follows the same font and colour across each section of the site to be in line with the theme. The section headers are the same font style(bolded) and colour(white). All the content text is white. The hover features are white and muted-pink throughout the entire site. The buttons throughout are all the same grey colour.

5. Error prevention - The available contact to me are all clickable links, opening in new windows for the browser applications and a new email application populated based on the email provider the user has signed up with. There is no form submit because of the potential errors in user submission and I was unable to implement this successfully within the short time frame.

6. Recognition rather than recall - Users are able to recognize where they are on the website with the clear nav bar and multiple buttons throughout the website advising them for a call to action. The header labels are bolded and animate to help aid this process.

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - The levels on the site is only 4, so they don't need to get through multiple layers to find the info. The information is all accessible via one click through a button.

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - There isn't any clutter on the site, and is very minimalistic. The core information is accessible via the nav bar by the first page visit and site map and if the user is interested in finding more the links are provided for them via a click. The content is spread throughout the page achieved through small and large font making the aesthetic streamlined.

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - I have uploaded a robot.txt file as part of the portfolio to aid in error handling through web robots.

10. Help and documentation - I've created through the sitemap available at the bottom of the site if the user is unaware of where they are on the site and I've also provided links in this documentation if users were interested in finding the sources I've used for my own code. 


### Any wireframes

My wireframe which I've kept the basic structure of but have amended through the development of the site.

### Style guide - font, theme, colours, pinterest

The font I used was a google font called Montserrat that is thin and on large and clear to read.

The theme as evident by my mood board on [Pinterest](https://au.pinterest.com/flavourable_26/portfolio-inspiration/)
follows a simple clean layout with a millenial style colours. I personally liked the neon-style font and imagery and have a penchant for the colour black. This helped with the theme of Miami vice.

The colors I've chosen include:
**#FFB6DA** light pink
**#7F787B** light grey
**#7E7E7E** slighty different grey

### Personal Logo

Logo design I created using Adobe Illustrator in line with my neon pink theme. The tutorial online can be found on my trelloboard.
