## Design documentation
My initial user stories and my design process and issue handling can be found at [Trelloboard](https://trello.com/b/WeldRh8d/site-audience)

My wireframe which I've kept the basic structure of but have amended the theme the code can be found:
If you download the Personal Portfolio.rb from the public file, you'll have a copy of it locally.

I also created a theme for my website on pinterest however I naturally gravitated towards black and pink as my colour scheme(neon-like)

Logo design I created using Adobe Illustrator in line with my neon pink theme. The tutorial online can be found on my trelloboard.

My design and usability of the site is simple and clear. The nav bar I made sticky to add to user experience. I removed the nav on
mobile devices because there's only 3 sections to my website which can be easily accessed via short scrolling.

I wanted to include extra features on my website but had issues executing this through ruby on rails and Javascript so I amended the layout to what I thought was achievable within the timeframe of one week.
